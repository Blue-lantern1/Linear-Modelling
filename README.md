# Linear-Modelling
Fitting and validating models
Course: EE798L: Machine Learning for Wireless Communications
– Generated different datasets following non-linearity, incorporated noise, fitted a linear model using least squares, fitted
a 5th order model using regularised least squares.
– Used K-fold cross validation fitted a 4th order model the gives the best predictive performance; fitted a 5th order model
using Maximum Likelihood approach
